# object-detection-using-yolo-algorithm
This project will basically describe the detection of object usinga different algorithm from the original,that is, the YOLO algorithm. It stands for You Only Look Once. As the name suggests, it looks at the image just once. Thus, it is much faster than the conventionally used algorithms. Normal and conventional algorithms go through the image multiple times at different scales. This approach makes them slow and inefficient. So in this algo we have to look the image only once and also go through the network only once thus making it fast and efficient.Lastly, we also detect images using a live video stream
